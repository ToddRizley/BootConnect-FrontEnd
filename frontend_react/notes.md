To Do:
  refactor code on front/back--some is extraneous?
  get articles to work
  get different profiles to work
  admin?
  authentication
  really go through front end and think about SoC/smart/dumb containers
    --> looks like we need more parent containers so make certain elements dumb
  logout button
